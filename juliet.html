                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I am an Engineering student at Duke University. I am from Austin, Texas so I enjoy cooking Tex
                        Mex, baking, running, live music and going out on the lake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Putting all of these together, my favorite day would be, after running in the morning, to go out
                        on the lake and wakesurf with great music playing, then to come home and make chips and guac for
                        everyone. Another thing, objectively, I make the best guacamole and ~partially~ make the best
                        chips in the world. First off, guac has to be chunky. You have to be able to visually see and
                        feel in your mouth the tomatoes, onions and cilantro. However, you don't want to be able to see
                        the serrano peppers--these must be chopped fine so that you get a little flavor in every bite.
                        Personally, I’m a spicy food lover so I like to leave in a lot of the seeds. If I’m cooking for
                        a big group though, there are most likely going to be weiners in the crowd who hate spiciness,
                        so I’ll remove the seeds. However, these people don't know how strenuous it is to remove the
                        seeds. While scraping them out, I almost always get the serrano chile oil in the crevices
                        between my fingers, which lingers with a slight burning feeling for the next two days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, the ingredients I use are ripe avocados, tomatoes with the juices squirted out, extra
                        onions, finely chopped cilantro, serrao peppers (finely chopped with or without seeds) and salt.
                        Lately, I have been persuaded to add lime, but I am extremely cautious due to the number of
                        store-bought guacs I have tried that are quite literally swimming in lime juice. These brands
                        are overcompensating on the acidity in order to combat the effects of oxygen on the avocados,
                        and resultantly, they completely destroy the flavor. I cannot remember the name of the cookbook
                        we get our measurements from, but it is the one in our house with tattered pages, extreme tomato
                        juice damage and avocado stains. You will notice how no where in my ingredient list did I
                        mention <i>sour cream</i> or <i>greek yogurt</i>. These do NOT belong in guacamole. Avocados are literal balls
                        of creamy, healthy fat and there is ABSOLUTELY no need to be adding those.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, in terms of the chips, if you want to have an amazing guacamole experience, you need to be
                        scooping it up with tostada chips. In our house, tostada chips entails cutting up flour
                        tortillas into triangles, frying those in a vat of oil, then making sure they have a generous
                        sprinkle of salt before serving hot. I say that I only ~partially~ make these because I have no
                        involvement in the actual tortilla making. I have to credit Central Market who quite literally
                        make the tastiest, fluffiest, most velvety flour tortillas I have ever had. Central Market does
                        all the work, we just add that extra infusion of fat and salt which takes ‘em to a whole ‘nother
                        level. In case you haven’t realized, these chips served by guacamole made my way is my favorite
                        meal.

                        If I could have any superpower it would be animal shapeshifting because then you technically
                        have all the superpowers. To become invisible, turn into a fly. To fly, turn into a bird. To run
                        fast, turn into a cheetah. To hold your breath, turn into a fish. My favorite shows are Game of
                        Thrones, Rick and Morty, Chef’s Table and Parks and Recreation. While I’m in Cape Town I really
                        want to see some safari animals.
